# teeny-latent-diffusion
A repository loosely implementing High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models (2021) in PyTorch. Written for experiments surrounding permissive datasets and data augmentation. Still a work in progress.

## Progress üöß

### VAE Prior üß¨
The following is a table of VAE reconstructions compared to ground truth, at 23,000 steps.
